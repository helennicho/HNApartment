# Developer notes : 


#  Lighting was experimental & proved to have variable results
#  Issues with unwanted dark shadows from the bookshelf & books led to unchecking the bookshelf.
#  Enjoyed the project although I found dealing with unexpected results in lighting shadows quite a challenge. 
# Did get a version working with music as well - fun !
# Achieved most of origial aims in the end :-) though dissapointed in quality of visual detail after baking lights and selectcing mobile performancce settings but project was interesting to do at this stage of VR NanoDegree
